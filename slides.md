# Context  

- How can we communicate with others about this piece of land?  
- We need all our users to be able to use the data 
  - Urban Planners  
  - Architects  
  - Software Engineers

# A first attempt

### How do we communicate about the site geometry?

````md magic-move {lines: true}

```json
{
  "site": <geometry>,
  "gpr": 3.0,
}
```


```json
// <well known text>
{
  "site": "POLYGON(...)",
  "gpr": 3.0,
}

// well known text is a common geospatial data interchange format
```

```json
// <well known binary>
{
  "site": 0xFFFFFF...,
  "gpr": 3.0,
}

// well known binary is the binary compressed version of well known text
// most dense format, but not human-readable
```

```json
// GeoJSON
{
  "site": {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
      {
        "type": "Feature",
        "geometry": {
          "coordinates": [...],
        },
      }
    ]
  },
  "gpr": 3.0,
}

// geojson is a standard geospatial data interchange format
```

```json
// ESRI JSON
{
  "site": {
    "geometry": {
      "rings": [
        [
          ...
        ]
      ],
      "spatialReference": {
        "wkid": 4326
      }
    }
  },
  "gpr": 3.0,
}

// ESRI's flavour of geojson for serializing their data formats
// directly supported by ESRI's products
```

```json
// <well known text>
{
  "site": "POLYGON(...)",
  "gpr": 3.0,
}

// For simplicity, let's use WKT
```
